# Rollappd - A minimal Rollapp chain

This repository contains an example of a working Cosmos-SDK RollApp.
It uses the least modules possible and is intended to be used as a starting point for learning build your own chain, without all the boilerplate that other tools generate. It can be seen as a simpler version of Cosmos-SDK's [simapp](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/simapp).
but prewired with `dymint` and `dymension-RDK`
